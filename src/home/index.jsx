          <h3>Paperwork Reduction Act</h3>
          <p className="text-small">
            According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not
            conduct or sponsor, and, not withstanding any other provision of
            law, a person is not required to respond to a collection of
            information unless it displays a valid OMB control number. The OMB
            control number for this collection is 3170-0008. The time required
            to complete this information collection is estimated to average
            between 7,700 hours and 77 hours per response depending on the size
            of the institution, per response. The obligation to respond to this
            collection of information is mandatory per the Home Mortgage
            Disclosure Act 12 U.S.C. 2801-2810 as implemented by CFPB’s
            Regulation C 12 CFR part 1003. Comments regarding this collection of
            information, including the estimated response time, suggestions for
            improving the usefulness of the information, or suggestions for
            reducing the burden to respond to this collection should be
            submitted to the Bureau at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
            (Attention: PRA Office), 1700 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20552, or
            by email to PRA@cfpb.gov. The other agencies collecting information
            under this regulation maintain OMB Control numbers for their
            collections as follows: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
            (1557–0159), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (3064–0046),
            the Federal Reserve System (7100–0247), the Department of Housing
            and Urban Development (HUD) (2502–0529), the National Credit Union
            Administration (3133–0166).
